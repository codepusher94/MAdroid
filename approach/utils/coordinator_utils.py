    other party to accept; the receiving user accepts the video call, and the video call window appears normally."

    break it down into are:
    1. You are the initiating user of the video call, and you need to open the chat with another user, click on the + sign, 
    initiate the video call, and then switch to device 2, wait for the other party to accept. 
    2. You are the receiving user of the video call, and you need to accept the video call and wait for the video call 
    window to appear normally.
    Note: You should add "switch to device x" in necessary place, especially when it is necessary to switch devices 
    after completing a task (or part of a task) on one device.
    Since our task is within the app, please do not include operations like opening/closing the app in the task description.
